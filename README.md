## About

This repository contains **Playwright automation projects** using **.NET** that you can use as **reference or tutorial material** when building your own test automation frameworks.  

Each project demonstrates **best practices in UI and End to End (E2E) testing**, including **Page Object Model architecture, data driven testing, configuration management, Docker integration, and CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions**.  

Whether you're exploring automated testing concepts or looking for a template for your own projects, these examples provide a solid starting point.

## Future Implementations

Planned improvements for this repository include:

- **Parallel Test Execution** – running tests concurrently to improve efficiency and reduce overall test runtime.  
- **API Testing Integration** – adding automated API tests to complement UI and E2E tests, demonstrating full-stack test coverage.
