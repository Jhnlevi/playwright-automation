## About

This repository contains **Playwright automation projects** using **.NET**, created as part of my journey to learn and improve automation testing skills. It is intended to serve as **reference material** for beginners who want to understand how to build their own test automation frameworks.  

Each project demonstrates **best practices in UI and End to End (E2E) testing**, including **Page Object Model architecture, data driven testing, configuration management, Docker integration, and CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions**.  

Whether you're exploring automated testing concepts or looking for a template for your own projects, these examples provide a solid starting point.

## How to Explore

1. Click on a project link above to open its dedicated README.  
2. Follow the instructions in the project README to set up and run tests locally.  
3. Explore the code, test data, and reports to see the automated workflows in action.

## Projects

- **[SauceDemo Automation (Playwright .NET):](./Playwright.SauceDemo/README.md)**

  *A fully featured test automation project for the [SauceDemo](https://www.saucedemo.com/) website. This project implements both UI and E2E testing, Page Object Models (POM), Data Driven Testing (DDT), and structured configuration management. It demonstrates practical use of Playwright for robust automation, cross browser testing, and reliable reporting.**

- **[ParaBank Automation (Playwright .NET):](./Playwright.Parabank/README.md)**

  *A UI focused automation project for the [Parabank](https://parabank.parasoft.com/parabank/index.htm) website. This project highlights cross browser testing, Page Object Models (POM), Data Driven Testing (DDT), and structured configuration management. It was created to further strengthen my Playwright and automation testing skills, particularly in locators, assertions, and test design principles.*

- **[JsonPlaceHolder API Automation (Playwright .NET):](./Playwright.API/README.md)**

  *An API focused automation project built with Playwright (.NET) for the [JsonPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) REST API. This project demonstrates API test design, request/response validation, and structured configuration management. It was created to strengthen my skills in API automation, Playwright’s testing framework, and reporting using ExtentReports.**

*(More projects will be added as I expand my automation portfolio.)*

## Future Implementations

Planned improvements for this repository include:

- [x] **Cross Browser Testing**: Running tests across browsers to ensure consistent behavior and compatibility
- [x] **API Testing Integration**: Adding automated API tests to complement UI and E2E tests, demonstrating full stack test coverage.
- [ ] **Parallel Test Execution**: Running tests concurrently to improve efficiency and reduce overall test runtime.
